# Phaethon

A seated VR podracer flown with two 3D-printed throttle levers, one per engine.

| `godot/audio/` | `engine_audio.gd`: per-engine V8 + V12 + turbine whine + roar (+ burner) voices driven by the levers, plus a bass rotor wound up by airspeed (a ~28 Hz rumble at rest, three octaves up by 1,500 mph) and the second engine (a rumbly big-bang four that lights above 1,500 mph and winds up with speed; sound only). Polish: twin engines that beat slowly, overrun pops on a lift, a rev spring that flares and barks. `engines/`: the baked loops |

## Sprint mode (the range)

Sprint 100 miles from a standing start, then stop dead inside the 50 m box at mile 100. The
clock starts when you push the levers and stops when the pod is still (under 0.5 m/s) inside
the box. More than 15 km past the box, or a crash, is a DNF. **Y restarts.** The best time is
saved to `user://sprint_best.json`. Full brakes from 4,450 mph take about 11.1 km (6.9 mi), so
the decision comes around miles 92–93. Countdown boards stand at 20, 15 and 10 down to 1 miles
to go, then at 1000, 500, 250 and 100 m; a light column and a STOP marker sit on the box.

```bash
.\launch_vr.ps1 -Track range                 # headset; add -WaitForHeadset to wait for Link
.\launch_vr.ps1 -Track range -StartMile 90   # practise just the braking
```

## Physics findings worth not rediscovering

- Cables anchored on the pod's front corners go unstable near 715 km/h: the pod hangs off one cable. Converge both cables on a nose ring (`podAnchorW` 0.15).
- Per-engine cable tension is a trailer-sway feedback loop (a 16°/s spiral). Route about 80% of it through a bridle on the binder (`cableCouple` 0.2).
- GDScript `float` is 64-bit; `Vector2` is 32-bit. Keep the sim in scalars or parity breaks.

## Engine audio findings

- One piano key and velocity layer per exhaust bank. Mixing keys or layers makes every pulse a different tone and the train stops reading as a pitch. (A 720-degree cycle holds `cyl` firings: count firing harmonics at `cyl` per cycle, not `cyl/2`, or the share reads high.)
- The V8 burble is the per-bank 270/180/90/180 rhythm left audible by an imbalance between banks. Set it with `bank_gain` *after* the soft clip, which normalizes each bank.
- Don't build a layer from per-RPM loops crossfaded into each other. It failed twice. Free-running bands interfere at a random phase, so each crossing is a fresh -5.6 to +2.4 dB roll and a fast lever move "skips". Phase-aligned bands fix the level, but each band still has its own timbre, so brightness pulses at every band (109-198 cents) and a ramp "steps through selected tones". What works: one master per layer, pitched with RPM (pulses fixed in crank angle), stored as zero-phase anti-alias levels an octave of pitch apart that stay sample-aligned. Crossfading those only fades the top octave. Fixed-frequency colour (muffler, roar filter) lives on buses, not in the loops. Gates: flat-run level within 2.5 dB of a smooth curve in RPM; brightness swing at the band spacing no bigger than at unrelated spacings.
- Don't phase-lock free-running players off `get_playback_position()`: Godot reports it in 128-frame steps, longer than a V8 pulse at 7,500 rpm. The same steps make short drift measurements look like ~100 ppm of resampler error that isn't there. Equal-length loops at equal `pitch_scale`, started in the same frame, stay sample-locked (measured: 0 frames apart after 30 s). `pitch_scale` above 4 works (tested 11.7).
- Headless Godot mixes through the Dummy driver in ~93 ms bursts, ~1% slow of the wall clock. Pitch can only change between bursts, so a headless capture of a sweep records as a staircase of tones that the game doesn't have: never judge a sweep by ear from one. `--audio-output-latency` doesn't reach the Dummy driver. Movie Maker mode (`--write-movie x.avi --fixed-fps 96`, needs a window) mixes once per frame. Clock audio tests off a silent player's `get_playback_position()`, not frame deltas.
- Bake a master near the RPM it's heard at. Pitched 6x up, the second engine's thud slid from chest to ~500 Hz (1% of its energy under 150 Hz at full lever). Baked at 3,000 rpm it measures 80% under 150 Hz there. Measure "rumbly" at full lever: averaging in idle under braking flattered the buzzy version.
- Give a new layer its own random stream in the bake, or adding it re-rolls every loop baked after it.
- Lever-driven pitch settles in a third of a second and then sits still while you climb thousands of mph. Speed has to drive pitch too: the rotor rides airspeed and the second engine's rpm lifts with it.
- Two identical engines at identical pitch sit at a fixed phase: a frozen comb, not a twin. A 0.35% offset (wandering +-0.15%) makes them beat. Turn it off in tests that isolate the crossfader, or every equal-lever stretch reads as a level fault.
- A spring spool (rising w 16 z 0.65, falling w 7 z 1.0) revs a stab to 90% in 0.14 s with a ~9% flare and lifts with no undershoot. Switching to the falling spring past the target is what sets the flare: the first try flared 18-23%. A ~0.1 s flare falls between 50 ms log rows, so the harness logs every frame.
- A shimmering, beating rumble (the rotor) has no clean line to pitch-track at 3%: grain phase smears each line by about +-7%. Track it through its spectral centroid against the logged pitch instead (measured r 0.99, ~1 octave per octave).
- A loop seam test that compares the jump to the loop's step distribution misfires on a nearly pure tone. Compare curvature across the join to its 23 ms surroundings instead.
- `AudioStreamWAV.data` is a getter that copies the whole buffer. Read it once, not per sample.
- The loops load raw with `AudioStreamWAV.load_from_file`, so an exported build needs `audio/engines/*` in the export's non-resource include filter.
